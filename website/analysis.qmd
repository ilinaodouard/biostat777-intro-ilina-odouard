title: "Example Data Analysis: Medicare Part D Drug Price Negotiation"
format: html
---

An example data analysis can be found below.

# Background

Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Medicare is allowed to negotiate the prices of certain drugs with high spending. In the first year of the negotiation program, Medicare was permitted to negotiate the prices of 10 Part D drugs with high budget impact.

# Objective

This analysis estimates what the annual spending on these ten drugs would have been between 2018-2022 if the new negotiated prices had been implemented during those years. The intended audience for this analysis is health policy researchers, policymakers, and members of the public who are interested in understanding the magnitude of the effect of negotiated prices on Medicare Part D drug spending for negotiated drugs.

# Data

The analysis uses Medicare Part D Dashboard data (@dashboard2024) and the negotiated prices for the first ten Part D drugs selected for negotiation. (@negotiation2024) Data dictionaries for the Medicare Part D dashabord data can be found here (https://data.cms.gov/resources/medicare-part-d-spending-by-drug-data-dictionary) and for the drug price dataset can be downloaded from here (https://www.cms.gov/inflation-reduction-act-and-medicare/medicare-drug-price-negotiation).

## Will it really make much of a difference on total Part D spending to negotiate the prices of only ten drugs?

Actually, yes! These ten drugs accounted for approximately 20% of total Part D spending in 2023. (@aspe2024)

#change brand and molecule names to lowercase
spending <- spending %>%
    mutate(brand = tolower(brand),
            molecule = tolower(molecule))

#adjust some molecule names to ensure match with drug price data
spending <- spending %>%
    mutate(molecule = ifelse(str_detect(molecule, "dapagliflozin"), "dapagliflozin", molecule)) %>%
    mutate(molecule = ifelse(brand=="entresto", "valsartan / sacubitrilat", molecule)) %>%
    mutate(molecule = ifelse(str_detect(brand, regex("^(novolog|fiasp)", ignore_case = TRUE)), "insulin aspart, human", molecule)) %>%

## Finalize Analytic Dataset

## Note on joining datasets

I used left_join to join the drug price and spending datasets. This way, only the information on the ten relevant drugs from the spending dataset are retained.

# Summary

This analysis demonstrated how negotiated drug prices would have impacted Medicare Part D spending on the ten drugs selected for the first round of negotiation. While spending would have continued to grow year-over-year due to increasing utilization, the negotiated prices would have reduced total spending on these drugs by nearly 50%. Apixaban, a drug treating blood clots, is the most influential in the total spending as it reached over $15 billion in spending in 2022. This would have been cut down to $9.7 billion if the negotiated prices had been implemented at the time. Comparing actual spending to hypothetical spending under the negotiated prices during these years, we can see some variation by drug. In 2022, the difference in spending would have ranged from -13% to -70% depending on the drug. The limitation of this analysis is that utilization in 2018-2022 may not be representative of utilization of these drugs in 2026 and beyond (when the prices are implemented).
