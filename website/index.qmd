Welcome to my website! I am a first-year PhD student in health services research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I also received my MPH from BSPH in 2022. I'm interested in improving value in the healthcare system, and my research focuses on this issue through the lens of prescription drugs. 

I am originally from New York, but I am thrilled to be in Baltimore. I love spending time outside, so here are some of my favorite places to go for walks or jogs in these two great cities!


Riverside Park, New York, NY
